# Micromanaged Driven Development (MMDD) - version 2

This development methodology uses systematic documentation to control AI-assisted software development through granular task breakdown and chronological tracking.

## Structure

A **unit** represents a major phase or component in the development process. Each unit may contain one or more **subunits**, which capture discrete build moments such as design decisions, iterations, or integrations.

Each unit/subunit is recorded in a markdown file within `dev_log/`, following the naming convention:

```
<sequence>_<unitname>[_subunit<number|name>].md
```

The `subunit` part is optional. Files are ordered using numeric prefixes to allow flexible sequencing.

## File Organization

```

├── dev_log/             # Chronological development units
│   ├── 00_mdd.md        # MMDD Description and MMDD version 
│   ├── 00_main.md       # Main project status and unit index
│   └── 01_first_unit.md # First Unit of your project, rename this file according to it
└── src/                 # Source code
```

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Create [01_main.md](01_main.md) and dev_log/ directory
2. **Plan Units**: Define 3-5 initial development phases
3. **Work Systematically**: Complete units sequentially, document AI interactions
4. **Track Progress**: Update [01_main.md](01_main.md) status regularly
5. **Provide Context**: Reference unit files when working with AI tools
