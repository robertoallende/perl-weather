# Unit 04: Legacy Code Patterns - "Poetic" Perl and Global Variables

## Objective
Transform the code into authentic legacy Perl with cryptic one-liners, inconsistent naming, global variables, minimal documentation, and "poetic" constructs that make it harder to read and maintain.

## Implementation
- Add more global variables with inconsistent naming conventions
- Implement "poetic" Perl one-liners and cryptic constructs
- Use legacy Perl idioms and unusual operators
- Add misleading or minimal comments
- Mix coding styles within the same file
- Use obscure variable names and abbreviations

## AI Interactions
Implementing deliberately poor coding practices to simulate real legacy production systems.

## Files Modified
- `src/weather.cgi` - Add legacy patterns and "poetic" Perl constructs

## Status: Complete
Legacy code patterns successfully implemented. Added inconsistent variable naming ($temp_val, $w_condition, $wCode), poetic Perl constructs (ternary operators, comma operator), additional global variables, heredoc XML generation, and cryptic one-liners. Code now authentically simulates hard-to-maintain legacy production systems.
