# Unit 05: Comment Removal - Strip Documentation

## Objective
Remove all comments and documentation from the source code to create an authentic legacy system feel. Legacy code often lacks proper documentation, making it harder to understand and maintain.

## Implementation
- Strip all explanatory comments from weather.cgi
- Remove inline documentation
- Keep only essential shebang and use statements
- Leave code completely undocumented like real legacy systems

## AI Interactions
Final step to make the codebase authentically legacy by removing all helpful documentation.

## Files Modified
- `src/weather.cgi` - Remove all comments and documentation

## Status: In Progress
Removing comments to complete the legacy transformation.
